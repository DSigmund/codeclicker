- BUG: resets on second ascension!


One idea for display of code which shouldn't be too complicated or completely change your game would be to have the actual code of the game be revealed one character at a time instead of the xs and Os. You could even keep it to the same little window, and have it scroll off the top as your added new code to the bottom.
hte ascii art box is nice, it stops adding new symbols at around the millions. It overflowed around 20m loc too. You could even put it as a background but with way larger font and a dark gray color.

>The functions to code bonus is nice. Maybe group the bonus and function buy button together visually so it makes more sense. Or add a "Current lines of code bonus" description to the button for clarity.

Hm ... i will think of something. right now its sorted horizontally. maybe ill make button groups. or better borders ...

> No achievement description :( So I don't know why I got Advanced AI 101 and some other stuff. 

Its in the title. so hover ...
But your right, i will make a clickable popup of sorts and a message on achiieving it


> Also achievements overlapped with the ascii art box on the right.


> I'm not sure yet what classes are supposed to do. But my function income seems to be mostly limited by how fast I can click the "Create Functions" button. There's a few million loc that I don't use. If I could use that to further upgrade function income or had some way to convert loc to functions faster without spending all my funcs that would be nice. If you couldn't buy classes until after first ascension (and maybe unlock more stuff after) that would make the ascension feel more meaningful.  

Well, Classes are built with functions and give a bonus to loc-creation. but it IS very unclear right now. i will think about this.
